            <p>Conway's Game of life: the interesting topic with the use of animation and grids and logic that allowed the team to set rules of population distribution and cells life.<br>

            Methodology: Methodology that we chose is PMI which is a five process groups that is initiating,planning,executing monitoring and closing.</p>
        
        <p>Rules<br>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.<br>
        Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<br>
        Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.<br>
        Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br><br>
        These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:<br>
        
        Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.<br>
        Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.<br>
        All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</p>
